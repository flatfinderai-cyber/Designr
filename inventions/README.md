# Invention Development & Automation System

## For Inventors: Automate Your Invention Workflow

This system helps you:
- **Document** inventions systematically
- **Prototype** designs automatically
- **Test** concepts iteratively
- **Build** working implementations
- **Iterate** on designs with Ralph

## How This Helps Inventors

### Traditional Invention Process:
```
1. Have idea
2. Sketch it out
3. Try to build it manually
4. Hit problems
5. Debug manually
6. Repeat 100 times
7. Maybe it works?
```

### Ralph-Powered Invention Process:
```
1. Have idea
2. Document it in a workflow file
3. Start Ralph loop
4. Ralph builds, tests, and iterates automatically
5. You review the working prototype
```

## What You Can Automate

### Software/Digital Inventions:
- Apps, tools, automation scripts
- Data processing systems
- APIs and integrations
- Browser extensions
- Any code-based invention

### Hardware/Physical Inventions (via CAD/simulation):
- 3D models and CAD designs
- Circuit simulations
- Arduino/Raspberry Pi prototypes
- Hardware control scripts
- IoT device programming

### Hybrid Inventions:
- Smart devices (hardware + software)
- Robotics projects
- Home automation systems
- Sensor networks

## Philosophy

**Every invention is an iterative process.**

Ralph excels at iteration - it tries, fails, learns, and improves. Just like inventing!

Your role: Define WHAT you want to invent
Ralph's role: Figure out HOW to build it through iteration
